assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information given
in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab in the file
~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the readme file,
and edit it as appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

N/A

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

Tedious but overall fine

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?


n/a

What warnings does splint generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."


symtablelist.c: (in function SymTable_remove)
symtablelist.c:222:9: Variable prior used before definition
  An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some execution
  path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)

        The variable prior keeps track of the node before the current key would be removed. Setting prior->next = current->next allows current to be removed and the nodes before and after are connected. If the first element is the one that needs to be removed prior need not be initialized. The warning is thrown because prior is initialized in a while loop that will not be entered if current is the first element. However, this is the desired logic as explained above and an if statement ensures that current will not be used if not initialized.

What warnings does critTer generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

What warnings does splint generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."


symtablehash.c:335:9: Variable prior used before definition
  An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some execution
  path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)


                The variable prior keeps track of the node before the current key in the linked list attached to the relevant bin of the hash table. Setting prior->next = current->next allows current to be removed and the nodes before and after are connected. If the first element is the one that needs to be removed prior need not be initialized. The warning is thrown because prior is initialized in a while loop that will not be entered if current is the first element. However, this is the desired logic as explained above and an if statement ensures that current will not be used if not initialized.
